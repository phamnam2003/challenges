## Refactoring

### Clean Code

- The main purpose of `Refactoring` is to fight technical debt. It transform a mess into clean code and simple design.

  - **1. Clean code is obvious for other programming**: Poor variable naming, bloated classes and methods, magic numbers, all of that makes code `sloppy` and `difficult to grasp`.

  - **2. Clean code doesn't contain duplication**

  - **3. Clean code contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts**: Less code is less stuff to keep in your head. Less code is fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple

  - **4. Clean code passes all tests**

  - **5. Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain**
