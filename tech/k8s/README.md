# Introduction

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/), also known as `K8s`, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. `Kubernetes` is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. `Kubernetes` services, support, and tools are widely available.
- Planet Scale: Designed on the same principles that allow Google to run billions of containers a week, `Kubernetes` can scale without increasing your operations team.
- Never Outgrow: Whether testing locally or running a global enterprise, `Kubernetes` flexibility grows with you to deliver your applications consistently and easily no matter how complex your need is.
- Run `K8s` Anywhere: `Kubernetes` is open source giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.
