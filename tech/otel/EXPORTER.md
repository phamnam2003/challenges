# OpenTelemetry Exporters Theory

## Conceptual Overview

OpenTelemetry Exporters are components responsible for transporting telemetry data from the OpenTelemetry SDK to various backend systems. They serve as the bridge between instrumented applications and observability platforms.

## Core Concepts

### Exporter Types

#### Push Exporters

- **Definition**: Actively send data to backend systems at defined intervals
- **Mechanism**: Batch data and push to configured endpoints
- **Examples**: OTLP, Jaeger, Zipkin exporters
- **Characteristics**: Real-time delivery, network-dependent, requires backend availability

#### Pull Exporters

- **Definition**: Expose data for collection by external systems
- **Mechanism**: Provide endpoints that backends can scrape
- **Examples**: Prometheus exporter
- **Characteristics**: Backend-controlled collection, reduced network overhead

### Data Transport Models

#### Synchronous Export

- Immediate transmission of telemetry data
- Blocks application execution until export completes
- Used for critical, low-volume data

#### Asynchronous Export

- Non-blocking data transmission
- Uses background threads or processes
- Preferred for high-volume telemetry data

## Architectural Theory

### Exporter Pipeline

- SDK Processing → Batch Processor → Export Queue → Exporter → Network → Backend
