# OpenTelemetry Sampling Theory

## 🎯 Core Concept

Sampling decides which traces to collect and which to discard, balancing observability needs with performance and cost constraints.

## 📖 Fundamental Principles

### Sampling Goals

- **Reduce data volume** and storage costs
- **Maintain statistical significance** of collected data
- **Preserve important transactions** (errors, slow requests)
- **Control performance overhead** of telemetry collection

## 🏗 Sampling Types

### Head Sampling

- Decision made at trace start
- Consistent sampling decision across entire trace
- **Examples**: AlwaysOn, AlwaysOff, Probability sampling

### Tail Sampling

- Decision made after trace completion
- Based on complete trace data (errors, duration, attributes)
- **Examples**: Rate limiting, Latency-based, Error-based

## 🔧 Common Strategies

### Probability Sampling

- Sample fixed percentage of traces (e.g., 10%)
- Simple and predictable cost
- May miss important low-frequency events

### Rate Limiting

- Sample maximum number of traces per time unit
- Protects backend systems from overload
- Ensures consistent data volume

### Adaptive Sampling

- Dynamically adjust sampling rate based on system conditions
- Sample more during incidents, less during normal operation
- Balance cost and observability needs

## 🎯 Decision Factors

### Trace Importance

- **Errors and exceptions**: Always sample
- **Slow requests**: Sample for performance analysis  
- **Business-critical transactions**: Higher sampling rate
- **Health-check requests**: Lower sampling rate

### System Context

- **Debug mode**: Sample everything
- **Production**: Sample strategically
- **High load**: Reduce sampling rate
- **Incident investigation**: Increase sampling rate

## 📊 Implementation Notes

### Consistency

- Sampling decisions must be consistent across distributed services
- Use trace ID hashing for probability sampling
- Ensure all spans in a trace have same sampling decision

### Overhead

- Sampling logic should add minimal performance impact
- Head sampling has lower overhead than tail sampling
- Consider sampling at collector level vs. application level
