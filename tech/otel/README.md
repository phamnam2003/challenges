# What is Open Telemetry (OTel)?

- `Open Telemetry (OTel)` is an `open-source` [*observability framework*](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/#what-is-observability) for *cloud-native software*, providing a set of APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to collect and export telemetry data such as `traces`, `metrics`, `logs`. `Open Telemetry` is a project under the `Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)` and is a merger of two previous projects: `OpenTracing` and `OpenCensus`.
- `Otel` designed to facilitate the:
  - [Generation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumentation)
  - Export
  - [Collection](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/components/#collector)
of [telemetry data](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/) such as [traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/), [metrics](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/metrics/), and [logs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/logs/)
- A major goal of `OpenTelemetry` is to enable easy *instrumentation* of your applications and systems, *regardless* of the programming language, infrastructure, and runtime environments used.
