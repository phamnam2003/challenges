# OpenTelemetry Instrumentation Theory

## Conceptual Overview

`OpenTelemetry Instrumentation` is the process of adding observability signals to application code to generate telemetry data (`traces`, `metrics`, `logs`). It serves as the foundation for collecting data about application behavior and performance.

## Core Concepts

### Instrumentation Types

#### Automatic Instrumentation

- **Definition**: Code that automatically injects observability into applications without developer intervention
- **Mechanism**: Uses techniques like bytecode manipulation, monkey-patching, or wrapper libraries
- **Scope**: Captures framework-level operations (HTTP servers, database clients, messaging systems)
- **Advantages**: Quick setup, consistent coverage, no code changes required

#### Manual Instrumentation

- **Definition**: Developer-written code that explicitly creates telemetry data
- **Mechanism**: Direct API calls to `OpenTelemetry SDK` within application code
- **Scope**: Business logic, custom operations, domain-specific metrics
- **Advantages**: Fine-grained control, business context, custom attributes

### Instrumentation Layers

#### Library Instrumentation

- Instrumentation built into third-party libraries
- Provides out-of-the-box observability for specific technologies
- Maintained by library authors or `OpenTelemetry` community

#### Application Instrumentation

- Custom instrumentation within business applications
- Tracks domain-specific operations and workflows
- Owned by application development teams

## üèó Architectural Theory

### Instrumentation Points

- **Entry Points**: HTTP servers, message consumers, event handlers
- **Exit Points**: HTTP clients, database calls, external service calls
- **Processing Points**: Business logic, data transformations, computation
- **Exception Points**: Error handling, fallback mechanisms
