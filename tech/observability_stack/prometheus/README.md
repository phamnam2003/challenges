# Prometheus

## What is Prometheus?

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an `open-source` *systems monitoring* and *alerting toolkit* originally built at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). It is designed for reliability and scalability, making it a popular choice for monitoring modern cloud-native applications and infrastructure. Prometheus joined the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) in 2016 as the second hosted project, after [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
- Prometheus `collects` and `stores` it's *metrics* as *time series data*, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
