# Logging for DevOps

- `Logging` is a *critical component* of `DevOps` practices, providing *insights* into system `performance`, `security`, and `user behavior`.
- `Logging` helps in *troubleshooting issues*, *monitoring applications*, and *ensuring compliance* with regulatory requirements.

## Introduction to Logging

- Managing logs *effectively* is essential for maintaining the *health* and *performance* of applications and infrastructure. When system needs centralized logging:
  - Distributed systems
  - Microservices architecture
  - Collecting logs for analysis and monitoring
  - Trace problems across multiple services, prescription problems
  - The log loss nature of the tool
  - Compliance and auditing requirements
  ...

## Types of Logs

- `Application Logs`: Generated by applications to record events, errors, and other significant occurrences.
- `System Logs`: Generated by the operating system to track system events, hardware issues, and other low-level activities.
- `Access Logs`: Record requests made to web servers, including details like IP addresses, request, Firewall, Nginx, etc.
- `Security, Audit Logs`: Track security-related events, such as login attempts, access control changes, and potential threats.
- `Event Logs`: Capture significant events within an application or system, often used for monitoring and alerting.
- `Trace Logs`: Provide detailed information about the execution of an application, useful for debugging and performance analysis.

## Designing a Logging Strategy

- Structure Logging: JSON format is widely used for its readability and ease of parsing.
- Context/Correlation IDs: Include unique identifiers to trace requests across multiple services.
